📈 Key Insights

Strong Overall Sales Performance:

Gross sales exceeded targets, showing solid revenue growth.

However, Net sales were slightly below target, indicating possible cost, discount, or margin issues.

Category Dominance:

The Bikes category is the main revenue driver, representing the majority of total sales.

Accessories and Clothing contribute smaller but consistent portions.

Balanced Gender Distribution:

Sales are nearly equally split between male and female customers, showing a well-balanced customer base.

Regional Analysis:

Australia, Southwest, and Northwest regions lead in both total sales and active customers.

These regions represent key markets for growth and customer engagement.

Product-Level Insights:

The Mountain-200 series dominates the top-selling products.

Low-performing items (like maintenance accessories) may benefit from targeted promotions or bundling strategies.

Customer Engagement:

Approximately 50% of total customers are active, indicating strong engagement potential but also opportunities to re-engage inactive users.

Seasonal Trends:

Sales increase notably during summer months, suggesting a seasonal demand pattern, especially for outdoor-related products.
